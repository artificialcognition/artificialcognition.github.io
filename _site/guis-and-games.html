	<p>So I thought I would do something fun and something I’ve been meaning to do. I remembered <a href="http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-9-the-evolution-of-code/">the chapter about genetic algorithms</a> which basically introduced me to all this and remembered that further along there was a little example of “smart” rockets that would get closer and closer to the goal with each generation. It really interested me at the time, but I couldn’t really do it in Python because I didn’t have a GUI that I could program.</p>

<p>Well today, I downloaded and installed <a href="http://pygame.org/news.html">Pygame</a> and set out to learn it through <a href="http://inventwithpython.com/makinggames.pdf">this free online book</a>. I’ll basically be working through it and it’ll be great. I think I’ll start on recreating that little rocket simulation and then maybe I can even do something cooler.</p>
