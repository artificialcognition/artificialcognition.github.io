	<p>I didn’t know if my program worked or not, so I decided to test it out. I decided to choose authors that wrote in English to ensure the use of the words that I looked for, were natural and consistent.</p>

<p>First, I would test it against different texts by Charles Dickens and then compare the texts to those by other authors around the same time period:</p>
<table style="width:100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>

<td>
</td>

<td>Oliver Twist
</td>

<td>Great Expectations
</td>

<td>A Tale of Two Cities
</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Oliver Twist
</td>

<td> 0%
</td>

<td>68.1%
</td>

<td> 60.4%
</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Great Expectations
</td>

<td> 68.1%
</td>

<td> 0%
</td>

<td> 52.1%
</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>A Tale of Two Cities
</td>

<td> 60.4%
</td>

<td> 52.1%
</td>

<td> 0%
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now, comparing different authors:</p>
<table style="width:100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>

<td>
</td>

<td>Pride and Prejudice
</td>

<td>Dracula
</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Oliver Twist
</td>

<td> 218%
</td>

<td>115%
</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Great Expectations
</td>

<td> 227%
</td>

<td> 127%
</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>A Tale of Two Cities
</td>

<td> 240%
</td>

<td> 112%
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So, that worked. I found that the same author had a percentage difference of &lt; ~70% whilst a different author would have a difference of &gt; ~110%.I also saw that a lower word count would lead to less accurate results, so I wanted to try the checker on a novella by Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol.</p>
<table style="width:100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>

<td>
</td>

<td>A Christmas Carol (29400 words)
</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Oliver Twist (171826 words)
</td>

<td> 63.0%
</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Great Expectations (190198 words)
</td>

<td> 97.8%
</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>A Tale of Two Cities (138330 words)
</td>

<td> 71.3%
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Thus, word count does indeed affect the percentage difference because a smaller lengthed novella would contain less of the typical function words used by the same author. However, even though A Christmas Carol is significantly shorter than the rest of the novels, the percentage difference was still smaller than the books by the other authors. And I suspect if I used a few novellas from the other novels, the percentage differnce will be even smaller. I also think that some of the tags I decided to target is a natural part of English and there might be a more personal list of words. Anyway, the longer the texts, the more accurate this program is.</p>
