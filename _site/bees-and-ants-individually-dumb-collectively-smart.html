	<p>Lately I’ve been reading about bees and ants, and I’ve found them fascinating. As individual creatures, they have relatively small brains (compared to humans) and cannot accomplish much. Yet, as a group, their behaviour is astonishingly complex!</p>

<p>For example, ants colonies are able to build awe inspiring structures, defend their territories, and find food. Bees can locate flowers, build hives and are able to divide work. I found out that this is the result of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence">swarm intelligence</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s a video that captivated me:</p>

<p>Like brains and artificial neural networks, Swarm Intelligence isn’t just limited to biological systems, but can also be artificially reproduced. I’ve found a few examples online already:</p>

<p>What I’m thinking about doing is creating little “ants” with their own artificial neural networks and running it so that their behaviour is modelled on what real ants would do. I could use this <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~borg/biotracking/recent-results.html">datasets like these</a>, for example. I think that their simple behaviour, would eventually give way to complex behaviour as seen in real life. But I don’t know if I’ll have the processing power to simulate this, since you need a lot of individuals for swarm intelligence to work.</p>

<p>Anyway, I’ll research some more about ants and see if that gives me any good ideas to implement in the future. :)</p>
