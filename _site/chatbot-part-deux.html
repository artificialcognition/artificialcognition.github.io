	<div class="divider"></div>

	<p>After finally managing to wait for it to process around 17,000 lines of dialogue which took ages, I thought it was FINALLY trained. And it was. It could answer questions, but it just took SO long. The first time I tried it, I thought I messed up somewhere, because it would just be stuck and I tried to look for the problem. I then gave up on it for a while and I accidentally left it running. After maybe an hour, I looked back and there was this single “how are you?” to my “hello”. I realised that the database was truly too much for the bot to handle and that this program is inadequate and needed to be slimmed down for it to function.</p>

<p>Hence, I modified the program a bit so that it would only add the dialogue from 5 of the 24 categories: small talk, daily life, food, socialising and travel. That only involved 3775 lines of dialogue to train, and it was done in less than 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Also additionally I found out about a cool command in VIM. I was changing the code so that I could choose whether or not to train the bot. In doing so, I needed to indent a whole chunk of code. I learnt that you could just use</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>10&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>to indent the next 10 lines.</p>

<p>Anyway, here’s the final piece of code:</p>

<p>And here are some test-runs. Obviously you can see that the chatbot works ok at times but at other times is irrelevant and off-topic. That’s both the fault of the small sample size, the sample itself, as well as the algorithm:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Me: hello
Bot: This is she. How's it going?
Me: it's going well. how are you?
Bot: It's nice to meet you. Thanks for coming.
Me: that's quite alright.
Bot: That sounds like a great idea!
Me: What are you talking about?
Bot: That sounds like a great idea!
Me: You are repeating yourself.
Bot: That sounds like a great idea!
Me: what are you doing?
Bot: I was thinking of maybe taking a drive to the beach.
Me: why are you going to the beach?
Bot: That sounds like a great idea!
Me: Where do you go to school?
Bot: Let's figure out what to do before lunch and later figure out what to do
Me: okay
Bot: I'll talk to you later.
Me: Bye
Bot: I enjoyed talking to you.
Me: So did I.
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Me: What are you cooking?
Bot That sounds like a great idea!
Me: I just came back from school. Where are you?
Bot That sounds like a great idea!
Me: Where do you go to school?
Bot Let's figure out what to do before lunch and later figure out what to do
Me: I feel like Subway.
Bot That sounds like a great idea!
Me: What is your name?
Bot You'll have to prove it was their error; then you can get an extension.
Me: How are you doing?
Bot I'm doing great. What about you?
Me: Good.
Bot I haven't been better. How about yourself?
Me: Do you like eating food?
Bot Maybe you should call your post office.
Me: lol
