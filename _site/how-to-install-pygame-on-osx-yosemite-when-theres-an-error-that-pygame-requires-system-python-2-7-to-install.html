	<p>When I was trying to install Pygame today, I tried to use the installer but out popped this error:</p>

<blockquote>pygame 1.9.1 release can't be installed on this disk.
pygame requires System Python 2.7 to install.</blockquote>

<p>This was frustrating so I used my google foo and found<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21806723/pygame-installation-fails-due-to-requirement-of-system-python-2-7-even-though-i"> a stackoverflow page</a>, exactly my problem. Now, I have to admit, it took me pathetically about half an hour to figure it out, even though the solution was ON that page, albeit somewhat obscured (at least to me), I just didn’t realise it.</p>

<p>I tried using homebrew, which for some reason needed to be reinstalled and then tried to do various things based on other links I found.</p>

<p>When that all failed, I looked back and found that once I installed XQuartz and used the MacOS 10.7 build, it worked. Here’s what you only have to do:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Make sure you have Homebrew and install XQuartz in Terminal</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>brew install Caskroom/cask/xquartz
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Step 2: Install Pygame with <a href="http://pygame.org/ftp/pygame-1.9.1release.tar.gz">this</a>.</strong></p>
