	<p>At the start, the car didn’t really move anywhere.</p>

<p>But, by the later generation, progress was made.</p>

<p>Today I played around with this website, that basically used genetic algorithms on cars. I read about how it was implemented <a href="http://boxcar2d.com/about.html">here</a> and it was interesting, because although there were differences, the fundamental principles were the same and I could understand it.</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking of combining neural networks and genetic algorithms to create a sorta “game of life”, with prey, predators and food. The thing I’ve been thinking about is how I would implement the fitness algorithm. Would I make it so that the prey that avoid the most predators and get the most food, are given more of a chance in the mating pool (as I have done previously with my other programs)? Or, should I go with a more organic approach whereby the prey who get “eaten” by predators are removed completely from the mating pool, as well as dying from hunger if they don’t reach food? I don’t know, but it’s interesting to think about.</p>
