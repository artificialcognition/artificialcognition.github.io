	<p>I just finished my exams so that’s why I haven’t been doing much lately. Today, I realised that my tic tac toe neural network powered genetic algorithm thing isn’t going to work the way it is at currently, but I did learn a few things.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I picked up the code that I had written a few weeks ago and I realise that it’s a pretty convoluted way of making tic tac toe and even more so if I wanted to create a neural network. First of all the input are not numbers, I made them letters (“x” and “y”) and blanks spaces. This would have made it hard to put as input for the neural network. If I were to change this, all my formatting for printing the game would have to change, and to be honest, I’ve forgotten half of how I coded that part, so that would have been a pain to do.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did learn about this function that returns the index of the max of a list (so you could say that it wasn’t all for nothing). Also http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/181/how-to-choose-the-number-of-hidden-layers-and-nodes-in-a-feedforward-neural-netw was quite informative.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I haven’t given up on this, I just to be honest, cannot be bothered rewriting the whole thing right now. I’ll do it maybe, when I’m bored and have forgotten my current frustration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>If and when I do redo everything, here is what I need to make sure to do (ie, a note to self):
    <ul>
      <li>create an easy way to reference the position of each square (ideally use one list instead of 3 in one for the squares)</li>
      <li>don’t use strings as the pieces, use numbers and rewrite the print function to replace them with letters.</li>
      <li>actually write out what I plan to do, so that I don’t make mistakes like this again (ie, not planning for what I plan to do.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Over the exam week(s), I happened across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory">Game Theory</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/GAMETHEORY">/r/GAMETHEORY</a>. And so I took a look into it. It’s pretty interesting stuff, and I’m thinking about “restructuring” this blog to make it more general. Sort of like a general blog where I can post my thoughts/projects relating to ideas that are interesting to me.</li>
</ol>
