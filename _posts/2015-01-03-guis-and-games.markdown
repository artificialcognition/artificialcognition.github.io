So I thought I would do something fun and something I've been meaning to do. I remembered [the chapter about genetic algorithms](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-9-the-evolution-of-code/) which basically introduced me to all this and remembered that further along there was a little example of "smart" rockets that would get closer and closer to the goal with each generation. It really interested me at the time, but I couldn't really do it in Python because I didn't have a GUI that I could program.

[!["Smart" rockets](https://artificialcognition.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/screen-region-2015-01-04-at-11-19-45.png?w=300)](https://artificialcognition.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/screen-region-2015-01-04-at-11-19-45.png)

Well today, I downloaded and installed [Pygame](http://pygame.org/news.html) and set out to learn it through [this free online book](http://inventwithpython.com/makinggames.pdf). I'll basically be working through it and it'll be great. I think I'll start on recreating that little rocket simulation and then maybe I can even do something cooler.
